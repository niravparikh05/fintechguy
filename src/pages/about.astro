      My workday runs from 10 AM to 7 PM IST, with a midday lunch break and short evening pauses.
      I front-load my meetings in the morning to keep afternoons dedicated to focused, uninterrupted work.

      I lead with business context, not just code.
      My process includes coaching, clarifying requirements, refining use cases, and staying hands-on through design, implementation, and delivery.

      I make informed decisions by gathering input from all sides‚Äîengineering effort, customer needs, and team bandwidth.
      This ensures that every release plan is realistic, focused, and deliverable.

      I see everyone as a peer‚Äînot a subordinate.
      I value open communication, proactive ownership, and thoughtful debate.
      We solve problems together, support one another, and grow as a team‚Äînot in competition, but in community.

      I lead with trust, not micromanagement.
      I expect team members to keep me looped in as needed, while I stay hands-off unless support is required.
      I do keep a close eye on overall progress to ensure smooth execution.
